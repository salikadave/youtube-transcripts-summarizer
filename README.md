## Youtube Transcripts Summarizer

## Running this project:
### Windows: 

* Navigate to project directory
* Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`\
For security reasons, Windows will not allow the scripts to run. Hence, this command will only for the current running process (i.e. the terminal window you are running commands in) allow any types of scripts to run. We don't want to tamper with Windows settings and need to develop as well, so this is a good work-around.
* Run  `Scripts/activate.ps1` **OR** `Scripts/activate`

### Linux / MacOS:

* Navigate to project directory
* Run `source activate`
